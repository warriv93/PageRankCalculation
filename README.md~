# PageRankCalculation
Information Retrieval class Korea University

Calculate probability by looping the matrixes and for every "1" on a row add them together. 
To be able to then at that corresponding position in the new matrix add "1" divided by nbr off occurrences.

Created power method array. And applied it to the matrix by using 4 loops.
first one: iterates the whole thing a 1000 times to get a better value
Next two, makes It possible to iterate though the whole 2 dimensional array (matrix). 
And the last one: out side of the last two mentioned loops will set the res arrays values to the new values for multiplying in to the matrix. And set res array back to "0",

Lastly
Ran the given algorithm to calculate the pageRanking
